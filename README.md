# Uber-Clone


Hi! This is the clone to the App based Taxi booking Services like Uber using React Native, TailWind CSS, Google Map API, Google Direction API, Google Distance Matrix, and Provider as state management in it. It's unstable and I won't be maintaining it. You can find some useful methods inside it, related to maps. You can also learn about maintaining the Complex UI on a single screen and animations and their visibility using Provider.


## Setup Guide

Setup Google APIs

- Go to your Google cloud platform and select your project or create a new project.
Search and active this API keys:
  - Places SDK for Android
- Maps SDK for Android
- Directions API
- Go to your Credentials, create an API Key

- You will put that API key in .env file on GOOGLE_API_KEY constant on driver and rider apps
    
## Features

- Automatic Zoom IN/Out on certain actions.
- Polyline Generation from current position to provided location.
- Places search form the destination TextField. (drop down list to show 5 places related to the search keywords).   
- Cab selection and cost estimator (dummy).
- Custom map style, like Uber.

Every data provided like cabs, cost etc are dummy but configured to easily apply the Api's with minor changes to it. Please add your api key's to Constant files and Manifest file.
